# q-dpico_picprogxxxx
Quick and dirty PIC16FXXXX programmer using the Raspberry Pi Pico and MicroPython 

Based on https://github.com/SyedTahmidMahbub/q-dpico_picprog72
In-Circuit Serial Programming (ICSP) is not universal for all PIC microcontrollers, that is why I have made different versions of the same script for different models.

Other changes include the removal of the boost converter circuit to reduce the complexity and number of components. This component can be directly replaced by a 12V power supply or a boost converter module.
